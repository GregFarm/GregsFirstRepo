## R Markdown
CHANGE THIS
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
SPEED <- cars$speed
DIST <- cars$dist

Linear_Reg <- lm(DIST~SPEED)
summary(Linear_Reg)
INTERCEPT <- Linear_Reg$coefficients[1]
SLOPE <- Linear_Reg$coefficients[2]

p_coef <- paste("R vaule = 0.807")
plot(SPEED, DIST, main= "Cars Speed vs Distance", xlab= "Speed", ylab= "Distance")
#abline to set the trend line. 
abline(Linear_Reg, col="red", lty=2, lwd=3)
cor(cars$speed, cars$dist)
mtext(p_coef)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
